### v0.25.0
- Added basic [build mode](../docs/build_mode.md), including brute force
- Added angle to coordinate display
- Added extended hud scale option (under quality of life in general settings)
- Added error message when recording without specifying a compatibility level
- Added `-cl` alias for `-complevel`
- Added automatic time suffix for demo file names
  - Add `$` to the end of your file name to trigger this behaviour
  - You may need to escape this character depending on environment (`-record ny01p\$`)
  - The suffix is only applied for "completed" runs
    - By default a run is assumed to be an IL, so a completed run is one that exits the first map only
    - To apply this logic for movies, use `-movie X` to set the _final map_ that your movie must end on. For example, a doom 1 episode run would use `-movie 8`. A d2all would use `-movie 30`
    - Runs with the same time will have a counter like normal demos (`ny01p006-00002.lmp`)
  - The suffix format depends on the type of run:
    - IL:
      - `9.97` is `997`
      - `10.94` is `010`
      - `1:01.03` is `101`
    - Movie:
      - `0:09` is `009`
      - `1:01` is `101`
      - `2:13:45` is `21345`
- Opening the menu pauses demo playback
- The join key now works during demo playback
- The restart key now works during demo playback
- Removed ENDOOM / ENDBOOM support
- Removed old tas tracers
- Removed -ffmap (use -warp)
- Removed the option to overwrite existing demos
- Improved mouse stutter correction formula (mikeday0)
- OpenGL windows are now resizable / maximizable (elim)
- OpenGL now stretches in full screen mode (elim)
- Terminal interrupt now exits without a message box on windows
- Fixed TNTR Map 30 comp option in MBF21
- Fixed minor memory leak from in-game restart
- Fixed dsda-format playback progress bar (for future demos)
- Fixed top left intermission time not showing right away in heretic
- Fixed iddqd / idclip key bindings in `-dsdademo` mode

#### Console
- Added `demo.export X` console command
  - Exports current demo buffer to file `X.lmp`
  - Existing demo will continue as normal
- Added basic feedback to console ("command invalid")
  - Unallowed cheats are interpreted as invalid
- Added context validations (some commands are invalid while recording)
- Enabled console in strict mode (most commands are invalid)

#### Tracker
- Added tracker to extended hud (unavailable in strict mode)
  - line (special)
  - sector (special, active, floor height)
  - mobj (health)
  - player (last damage dealt)
- Added tracker console commands:
  - `tracker.addline X` / `t.al X`: adds line index X to tracker
  - `tracker.removeline X` / `t.rl X`: removes line index X from tracker
  - `tracker.addsector X` / `t.as X`: adds sector index X to tracker
  - `tracker.removesector X` / `t.rs X`: removes sector index X from tracker
  - `tracker.addmobj X` / `t.am X`: adds mobj index X to tracker
  - `tracker.removemobj X` / `t.rm X`: removes mobj index X from tracker
  - `tracker.addplayer` / `t.ap`: adds player to tracker
  - `tracker.removeplayer` / `t.rp`: removes player from tracker
- Added tracker command line arguments:
  - `-track_line a [b c ...]`
  - `-track_sector a [b c ...]`
  - `-track_mobj a [b c ...]`
  - `-track_player`
